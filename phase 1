Health & Wellness Tracking Portal - Phase 1
The Health & Wellness Tracking Portal is an application designed to help patients monitor their health metrics and enable healthcare providers to track wellness trends. The system allows patients to log vital information such as blood pressure, sugar levels, and other health indicators, while doctors and health coaches can analyze these inputs through dashboards and reports.
Beyond simple record keeping, the portal identifies at-risk patients, highlights common health issues, and promotes proactive healthcare management. It integrates health tracking, analytics, and patient-doctor engagement into a single platform—an innovative solution for lifestyle and wellness management.
